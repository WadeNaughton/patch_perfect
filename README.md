# What this is 

- A site designed to find peaks within the white mountains that are above 4000 feet. Users are able to favorite hikes or mark them as completed. Completed hikes have the ability to have journal entries, photos, and gear used on the hike displayed. A user can then add any friends that participated on the hike to the trip report. This is designed to be a digital journal, which I believe will be helpful for hikers to keep track of notes/photos, while also enjoying the social aspect of being added to other hikes.
