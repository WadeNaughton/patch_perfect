# What is this?

- A hiking site centered around finding and recording peaks within the White Mountains that are above 4000 feet in elevation. Users have the ability to search or browse the peak, and then mark a peak as either completed or favorited. A completed hike allows the user to build a digital journal entry of sorts to keep track of any pictures/notes from the trip. Users can also add others to the trip report, which adds a level of collaboration if desired. Each peak page allows the user to obtain directions, current weather, hourly weather, forecast for the week, as well as find campgrounds within a radius of their choosing.
